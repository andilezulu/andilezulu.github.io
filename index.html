    <h2>Welcome to my dev. world!</h2>
    <p>You might be wondering, what is Flutter or Dart?</p>
    <p>Well, according to the Flutter website, “Flutter is an open-source framework by Google <br>for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.”</p>
    <p>“Flutter transforms the app development process. Build, test, and deploy beautiful <br>mobile (iOS and Android), web, desktop, and embedded apps from a single codebase.”</p>
    <p>And <b>WTF is Dart</b> then?</p>
    <p>“Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform.</p>
    <p>Dart is a programming language designed for client development, <br>such as for the web and mobile apps. It is developed by<br> Google and can also be used to build server and desktop applications.” - Wikipedia</p>
