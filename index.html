    <h1>Andile Zulu: Aspiring Flutter & Kotlin Backend Developer</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my dev. world!</h2>
    <p>You might be wondering, what is Flutter or Kotlin Backend Developer?</p>
    <p>Well, according to the Flutter website, “Flutter is an open-source framework by Google <br>for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.”</p>
    <p>“Flutter transforms the app development process. Build, test, and deploy beautiful <br>mobile (iOS and Android), web, desktop, and embedded apps from a single codebase.”</p>
    <p>And <b>WTF is Kotlin</b> then?</p>
    <p>Kotlin is a modern but already mature programming language aimed to make developers happier. <br>It’s concise, safe, interoperable with Java and other languages, and provides <br>many ways to reuse code between multiple platforms for productive programming.</p>
    <p>Kotlin is a great fit for developing server-side applications. It allows you to write concise <br>and expressive code while maintaining full compatibility with existing Java-based technology stacks, all with a smooth learning curve - JetBrains</p>
